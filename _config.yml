  Hello, and Welcome to my website, it's designed to be both succinct and functional. For full verbosity regarding my resume, please visit my linkedin. Information about my projects are displayed here. As of 04-07-2021, this site is incomplete. I will be continually aggregated and posting my projects here as I cope with losing one of my encryption keys.

  This was several years ago, and I still don't know where that key is. Due to that key mistake I made, some of my work from my undergrad is missing. (Pun intended - please disregard)

  On the bright side, a great deal remains - which I will display here.
