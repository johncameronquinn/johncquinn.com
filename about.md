Hello! My name is John Quinn, and I guess this is the place where I'm supposed to talk about myself.

###Really short

- I love creative writing, and writing in general
- Graphic design is super fun. I consider myself a creative type but with technology.
- public speaking is a rush, in a good way
- I'm just generally team-oriented
- leadership is really fufilling for me
- competitions have been really fun for me in the past

###Interests

- cybersecurity is great
- I generally enjoy all opportunities to build things
- and to repair things
- and to design things
- I've got a blue collar background, and can fix most things in most houses, and also your car. 
- Jack of all Trades master of none, but hopefully good enough at some of those trades for it to be marketable


###Musings
I'm pretty interested in privacy, and propagating the ability for people to have more privacy and security.
I pay pretty close attention to AI, blockchain, and all other manners of new technologies. I remember back in 2013 staring at the $300 I had been given
from my grandmother and looking at the price of bitcoin ~$12, and deciding investing in high-risk cryptocurrency wasn't worth it at 17.

I've run out of people who I can talk to about the benefits of end-to-end encryption using PGP. We've got to make that easier for people.

### Amatuer Consulting
I've found myself friends with a bunch of smart people who had little to no tech knowledge, especially when I attended USC-Columbia.
