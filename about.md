Hello! My name is John Cameron Quinn, and welcome to that place where I'm supposed to talk about myself.

I suppose I could write a great deal about what I enjoy, what I believe in, or all other manner of verbosity, but I will do my best to keep it reasonably short and relevant.

Really Short:

- I love creative writing, and writing in general
- public speaking is a rush, in a good way
- leadership is really fufilling for me
- competitions have been really fun for me in the past too

But Also:

- cybersecurity is great
- I generally enjoy all opportunities to build things
- and to repair things
- and to design things

I see myself as a creative type but really deep in the technical details. I want to work on a team, with people, performing that kind of complex work creatively.

To note - I take the word creative as a bit different than others. I see entreprenuers as artists, for example. 

I've also run out of people who I can talk to about the benefits of end-to-end encryption using PGP. We've got to make that easier for people.

Graphic design is also quite fun, I like being (very) handy with photoshop if I can help it. 

I contributed to Whonix OS, a distribution that is radically effective, presumably, at ensuring your privacy when accessing the darkweb. The model for it is quite impressive. 

I'd love a future where I would be working long hours in a quiet environment (easier to focus and accomplish tasks), and then just get the hell out - into the wilderness, and shiver in the 25 degree weather hoping that my fire will light. Ideally with the same people from my work.

I suppose I might have missed out on the goal of minimizing verbosity, but I find attempting to summarize myself might be quite a small task.

Amateur Consulting

I've enjoyed meeting and getting to know many types of people across many different cultures.
At USC-Columbia most of my friends were traditional sports fans, and heavily involved in the business community there. I became their go-to "tech guy".
I was honest that I didn't really know a ton, but I knew a lot more than they did, and I served as an amatuer consultant for quite a while as a result.
I managed to make quite a profit off of that network over time, which lead to me helping out with a number of different startups.
