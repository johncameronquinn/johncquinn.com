### utilizing pgp

Greetings,

For those of you who know how to use pgp, I've implemented multiple ways of distributing my public key, I also have a secure key handling system for my private keys. Considering my current threat model, this should be more than sufficient to ensure that you are indeed speaking with me and only me.

Here are the ways to get my public key. Those who are more interested in ensuring I am not being impersonated should opt to combine methods. This is standard operation security, in case someone manages to break into this website - for example.

### Key Retrieval Methods
>The public key is attached to any outgoing emails I send.

>It can be downloaded from this website here: [pgp-key-direct-dl](/quinn.pubkey.txt).

>It can be retrieved using gpg from keys.openpgp.org - it is listed under my email address mail-at-johncquinn.com.

>It can be retrieved using the [online search](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=mail%40johncquinn.com) for keys.openpgp.org 
 
>I will also be distributing it in some form using business cards


This is all probably absolute overkill considering my thread model, but I'm not intendeding to change this public key of mine anytime soon, so I consider this future-proof
