## Hello! My name is John.

this is what I look like

![profilepic](/resumepic.jpeg){:class="profile-pic"}

### Really short bits about me

- I love creative writing, and writing in general
- Also love getting lost in my work, even when it's all in terminal screens
- I consider myself a creative type but with technology.
- public speaking is a rush, in a good way
- I'm just generally team-oriented
- leadership is really fufilling for me, I've just always gravitated to it in some form
- competitions have been really fun for me in the past

### General Interests

- cybersecurity is great
- I generally enjoy all opportunities to build things
- and to repair things
- and to design things
- I enjoy some graphic design, branding, marketing, and just generally being handy with photoshop
- I've got a blue collar background, and can fix most things in most houses, and also your car. 
- Jack of all Trades master of none, but hopefully good enough at some of those trades for it to be marketable.


###  Musings
I'm pretty interested in privacy, and propagating the ability for people to have more privacy and security.
I pay pretty close attention to AI, blockchain, and all other manners of new technologies. I remember back in 2013 staring at the $300 I had been given
from my grandmother and looking at the price of bitcoin ~$12, and deciding investing in high-risk cryptocurrency wasn't worth it at 17.

I've run out of people who I can talk to about the benefits of end-to-end encryption using PGP. We've got to make that easier for people.

I'm really interested in working for a company that's doing good work, even if that work is good in a small way. Even the gaming guild I run is providing a positive service to humanity. Sure, it's on a tiny scale, but most of us are tech professionals who have long busy days - so have a place where people can recharge for their next work day? Quite beneficial indeed.

I wish people my age studied more computer science history. There isn't that much of it, but we're second generation computer scientists and we better act like it. Original innovators who've built the foundations that will likely last for decades to come are still alive and contributing. That's really cool.

I think we should understand the history of what this industry is and how it got here for countless reasons. The story of Bell Labs and Unix is a great read, for example, if someone wants to understand the various wars over these new technologies from their onset.
